    <h2> Chapter 1: The Dawn of Console Gaming</h2> 
    
    <p> Back in the 1950s and 1960s, <img src="1.jpg" ALIGN="left"> 
 before modern consoles such as the PS4 or the Xbox One, computer <br> 
 scientists begun to make simple games
on computers, such as MIT's "Spacewar!" in 1962, being the very<br>first game playable with a video display. 
 However, the first true video game console would made in 1972<br> by Ralph H. Baer and Magnavox, named the Magnavox Odyssey.</p>
  <br> 

  <h3>The Beginning of A Magnavox Odyssey</h3>
  <img src="2.jpg">
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Magnavox Odyssey is known for being the very first video game console. It's creator, Ralph H. Baer, got the<br>
        idea for games to be able to be played on a TV set while waiting for a colleague at a bus stop. In 1967, he presented a<br>
         prototype to his directors at work, and his directors encouraged him to make it something to sell. In 1971, The Magnavox<br>
         Odyssey was finally released in retail stores. However, the console was far more expensive than Ralph first envisioned, <br>
         despite having attempted to reduce the price as much as possible. Ralph blamed the high price on the Magnavox's "lousy<br>
          enginnering", claiming they "over-enginnered" the machine.</p>

   <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, there were other competitiors, such as the Coleco Telstar, which could<br>
     only play video tennis like the Magnavox Odyssey, but it was at half the price of the Magnavox Odyssey, and as such got<br>
      far more sales than the Magnavox Odyssey. The Nintendo Color TV Game, Nintendo's first videogame console, sold<br>
       around 3 times as much as the Coleco Telstar did. However, the first truly innovative console would only come in late 1976.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> Chapter 2: The Second Generation: The Fairchild Channel F and The Impact of The ROM Cartridge</h2>
    
    <img src="3.jpg" ALIGN="left"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Fairchild Channel F was designed by Jerry Lawson and was released by Fairchild Camera<br>
         and Instrument in November 1976. It is the first console to use ROM Cartridges, which allowed larger<br>
         video games to be ran on consoles, such as the later released Atari 2600 and many other consoles after.<br>
          The creators of the ROM Cartridge, Wallace Kirschner and Lawrence Haskel, were also the creators of<br>
           a prototype version of the Fairchild Channel F.</p> 

           <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Despite this, the Atari 2600 (branded as the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS)) largely <br>
             overshadowed the Fairchild Channel F, as it had far better technology than the Fairchild Channel F and<br>
             &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had better games in general. Despite being $20 more expensive, it had far better video game options than<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Fairchild Channel F.

    <br>
    <br> 
    <h2> Chapter 3: Crash & Burn</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Despite the revolutionizing impact the ROM Cartridge made on the generation and future generations, the crash of the<br>
        video game market happened. There were many reasons this happened, from the large amount of consoles competing against each other,<br> 
         to the large amount of poorly made video games. The computer had also gotten cheaper since the last decade, and people thought<br>
         that computers were a better investment than video game consoles in general. The industry wouldn't recover until 1985.</p>

    <h3>Nintendo: Entertainment System</h3>
    <img src="4.jpg" ALIGN="left"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Nintendo Entertainment System (or the Famicom in Japan) was the system that would<br>
         save the video game industry in 1985. The unique design that most people think about when asked<br>
 to visualize the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) was designed to look like a video casette<br>
  recorder, in order to differentiate the console from past video game consoles due to the recent market<br>
   crash. The controller it came with had a D-Pad and 2 face buttons. This layout was used because<br>
    Nintendo had to consider that multiple genres of games with different control schemes would be<br>
 played on the NES. As such, they had to make a controller that could support most games on the NES.

          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Nintendo Entertainment System is currently the 7th best-selling video game console,<br>
             &nbsp;a surprising feat for a console made in 1983.
               The NES (Nintedo Entertainment System) is most<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known as being the console to revitalize the video game market, and showed that consumers still<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had interest in video games. It is also the console in which many well-known franchises debuted,<br>
                 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as The Legend of Zelda, Mega Man, Castlevania, and many others.

    <h2>Chapter 4: Competition: Sega's Mega Drive</h2>
    <img src="5.jpg" ALIGN="left"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The Sega Mega Drive (or The Sega Genesis in the USA) was Sega's answer to Nintendo's
        <br> new console, the SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System). Despite sales in Japan being
        <br> rather poor compared to other consoles at the time, it achieved considerable success in North
        <br>America, Brazil, and Europe. There were multiple reasons for this success, from aggresive
        <br> youth marketing to the popularity of Sega's Sonic The Hedgehog.</p>
        <br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When Nintendo released the Super Famicom(SNES) in the US, it triggered a fierce battle
        <br> between Sega and Nintendo for market shares known as the "console war". The Sega Genesis
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;
        also faced some controversy from the public, due to violent games such as Mortal Kombat and
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;
        Night Trap, which resulted in Sega creating the VRC (Videogame Rating Council) which lead
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;
        to the videogame industry creating the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board)</p>

<br>
<h2>Chapter 5: The Playstation: Sony Strikes!</h2>
<img src="6.jpg" ALIGN="left"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Playstation entered the videogame market in late competing against the Sega Saturn and the
    <br> Nintendo 64. It was also Sony's first attempt at making a videogame console. However, somehow, it far
    <br> outsold the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn. The Playstation was one of the most notable users of 
    <br> the new CD-ROM, a new form of game storage first introduced in the 5th generation. 
    <br> CD-ROMs could store much more data than cartridges, and as such, interested more game developers
    <br> to make games for the console. </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Playstation managed to outsell both the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn due to it's 
    <br>usage of CD-ROMs and it's large 3rd party support. Alongside that, the Playstation gained
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
     its success due to a wide variety of popular franchises, such as Castlevania, Final Fantasy,
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
     Dragon Quest, and many others, along with popular games such as Crash Bandicoot and 
    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    Metal Gear Solid.</p>
     <br>
<h2>Chapter 6: Playstation 2: Money moment</h2>
<img src="7.jpg" ALIGN="left"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Playstation 2, released on March 4th, 2000, competed against the Nintendo Gamecube,
    <br> the Sega Dreamcast, and Microsoft's first console, the Xbox. As you may know, the Playstation 2 is,
    <br> indeed, currently the best-selling video game console of all time. It achieved this due to multiple
    <br> factors, one of them being the fact that it was backwards-compatible with the PS1, therfore allowing
    <br> consumers with a PS1 to upgrade more affordably and play their old games on the new system. It also
    <br> allowed developers time to develop games for the PS2, as most consumers would play their old games 
    <br> before new games would come out.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Another reason the Playstation 2 has the title of "Best-selling Videogame Console of All-Time" 
    <br> was due to the large library of games it had during its lifespan. It had great third-party support, with 
    <br> games like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts. It was also, surprisingly, marketed as a DVD Player 
    <br> when it first launched. The Playstation 2 was much more cheaper compared to other DVD players
    <br> at the time, so families would buy the PS2 as both a DVD Player and a console.</p>
    <br>
<h2>Chapter 7: Wii: Wii're moving!</h2>
<img src="8.jpg" ALIGN="left"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Wii was released by Nintendo on the 19th of November, 2006. It was underpowered compared to its
    <br> competitors, the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360, but this made its games cheaper to produce. Despite it being
    <br> clearly underpowered compared to its competitors, it had backwards compatibility with the previous console,
    <br> and a gimmick that made it interesting, Motion Controls.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Wii is widely known as being the first console to utillize Motion Controls in its games. The usage
    <br> of Motion Controls in some games were considered forced, while others felt right at home, such as Wii Sports, 
    <br> where the motion controls seemed to be used to their fullest potential. While the Wii definitely wasn't perfect
    <br>  or had superb processing power, it had very memorable games and its usage of Motion Controls was revolutionary.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
<center><p>In the end, video game consoles will continue to improve over their previous generation's consoles,
    <br> and the technology within them will continue to grow.</p></center>
